gris
====

gris is a simple module for reading bibliography data in
RIS format (see `Wikipedia`_ for more info).

The module transforms each entry in a dictionary whose keys
correspond to the two letter RIS tags. Two conventions are
used: conventional RIS and that used by Thomson's
Web of Knowledge.
