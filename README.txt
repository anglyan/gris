About gris
----------

gris is a minimalistic tool to read, parse, and 
write reference data in RIS format.

RIS format codifies bibliographic data using a series of tags. There
are two different standards: the RIS output by Thomson Reuter's
Web of Science and the so-called Refman RIS that is used by other
providers. This module aims to supporting both.

This module has been ported to run in Python 3
