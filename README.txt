About gris
----------

gris is a minimalistic tool to read, parse, and
write reference data in
[Refman RIS format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)).

RIS format codifies bibliographic data using a series of tags. There
are two different standards: the RIS output by
Web of Knowledge and the original standard is used by other
providers. This module supports both.

This module has been updated and tested in Python 3.7
