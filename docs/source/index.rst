gris documentation
==================

About
-----

``gris`` is a lightweight parser for RIS files.

The `RIS data format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)>`_
is a standardized format to exchange citation and bibliographic data. It 
is widely used by digital libraries and library catalogs.

This package implements a parser and conversion tools to extract data from
a bibliography and store data in other more common formats, such as ``json``.


Install
-------

Install ``gris`` directly using ``pip``::

   pip install gris

Alternatively, bleeding edge code can be found in `github <https://github.com/anglyan/gris>`_
